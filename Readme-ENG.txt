Producer -consumer : the canteen
Simulate washing dishes in a canteen . Students bring their dishes to wash after eating
(eat in 1-5 seconds). Then, for each dish, there are two different actions: wash and rinse.
There are 7 people working in the canteen, 3 washer and 4 rinser. Each of them needs 1-5 seconds to
wash/rinse a dish.
Simulate the arrival of 100 students, at random intervals. The program will stop when all the dishes are
rinsed.
The program must not use neither synchronized nor explicit locking .
